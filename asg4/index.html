		<p><strong>Why StrayKids is my least favorite band</strong></p>	
      <p>I think stray kids arguably is one of the worst kpop bands out there (please do not hate me). I think their concept is a bit cringe and they can come off as imature. I liked their music when they first debuted, but overtime, I think they lost the vision they had in mind initially and it came across as messy. I think the group itself is very talented and they have great members, but the managment of the group and overall production has gone downhill from since their debut (2018). </p>
		<p><strong>Other bands I believe are better but have similar music styles</strong></p>
