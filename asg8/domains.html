      <h2>Discussion Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The 3 Possible domains for my website are: <strong>KpopCash.com</strong>, 
        <strong>IdolBudget.com</strong>, and <strong>FandomFunds.com</strong>. We discussed that the domain name should be something
        straightforward and easy to understand. Something that was short but memorable was something I took into consideration
      </p>

      <p>
        After considering this feedback, I decided on <strong>KpopCash.com</strong> .Its memorable, and clearly states the purpose of
        and directly conveys the purpose of the project. The name is easy to type, appealing to the target audience, and combines both themes of Kpop and Budgeting.
