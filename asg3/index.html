		<p><strong>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious).</strong></p>	
      <p> For this link, while it's not the worst, it's inconsistent with its buttons. The other rounded buttons at the top to locate more is a clickable item, but the other rounded buttons below the title are not clickable. From the first impression, I would also believe that those would be clickable since the other ones are but its not consistent. </p>

      <p>Framing your project in a story format will help you guide the design process to better help with the user experience. Having the project setup similar to a story, with characters, scenarios and a central goal, makes it easier for designers to see how to potentially solve these problems by highlighting empathy. Ideas like user personas, interviews and user surveys, allow us to put ourselves in users shoes to understand from their perspective making a more engaging and human centered experience. </p>

	<h2>Part 4</h2>
	<p><strong>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</strong></p>
	<p>I believe that the method of aiming for “good” instead of striving for the superlative would be the most successful for me. After 3 years of college surrounded by other creative and successful individuals, I have put a hard expectation on myself to always go above and beyond in everything I do. While this is a good idea in theory, in the end, I often times find myself nitpicking at my own work and putting myall in something that maybe wasnt as big of a deal as I made it to be. By constantly seeking forperfection, I have overlooked what I have already accomplished and also feel as though I never work hard enough to achive better things. Being able to accept that sometimes “ good” or “average” is enough would help me find the balance between giving out meaningful work while still keeping a healthy environemnt for growth. </p>

	<p><strong>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</strong></p>
	<p>Hyperbolic discounting is essentially the tendency to want to complete smaller immediate rewards over long-term rewards. This shows why many people give into the idea of short-term gratification. While they are satisfied in that moment, in the long run, they will regret choosing short-term gratification over the more daunting task but more benefiital reward. 
One method that is talked about in the article to help counteract hyperbolic discounting is to make choices in the present to stop your future self from procrastinating. For example, using apps that block social media on your phone to stop you from getting distracted. 
I believe this method works best for me and is something I personally do to help myself from getting distracted. On different apps such as tiktok, I have a timer that will lock out if I go past a certain screen time on that certain app. </p>

	<p><strong>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</strong></p>
	<p> I have some network-making power as I am able to control what content to share, how its design as well as the audience its designed for. While I am able to control these factors there are also many other parentsI am not able to control such as algorithm of the potential users and their ability to find my website through the web. While I can influence accessibility and engagement  through how I design my applications, the overall structure has more of an influence on how my work is seen.
