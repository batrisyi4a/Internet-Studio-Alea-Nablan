		<p><strong>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious).</strong></p>	
      <p> For this link, while it's not the worst, it's inconsistent with its buttons. The other rounded buttons at the top to locate more is a clickable item, but the other rounded buttons below the title are not clickable. From the first impression, I would also believe that those would be clickable since the other ones are but its not consistent.

	<h2>Creative Brief</h2>

	<h2>Part 4</h2>
	<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
	<p>Kpop fans are constantly overspending on merch, concerts, new album releases etc. They stand in a lot of different groups and don't know how to manage/track their finances that they spend on these groups. The concept of â€œmoney comes back but the memories don't" is a term that a lot of fans (including myself) use to justify these purchases. While its fun to use this mindset, its not fun when you are 10k in credit card debt. </p>

	<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>
	<p>The primary audience for this project would be targeted to overspending K-pop fans (or just fans in general) who spend a lot on concerts, albums merchandise and other fan items. </p>

	<p><strong>Competition</strong></p>
	<p>Competition would be existing budgeting apps and tools and also possibly fan communities that talk about spending habits. </p>
