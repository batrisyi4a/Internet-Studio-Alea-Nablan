	<p>boynextdoor (also known as bnd) is a 6 member boy group under the label hybe (specifically under zico, former member of blockb) i love their music because i believe that they have such a wide variety of music that you can listen to. some of my favorite songs are: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>dangerous</li>
		<li>our</li>
		<li>123-78</li>
		<li>serenade</li>
	</ul>

	<p>i really enjoy specifically the member sungho and leehan. sungho is the oldest of the group and is one of the main vocals. i also really like leehan because i think he has a really unique personality. (psttt he is a fish lover)</p>
