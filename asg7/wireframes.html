      <h2>1. Advantages and Disadvantages of Sketching Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Sketching wireframes allows designers to quickly brainstorm ideas and visualize layouts 
        without worrying about technical precision. It encourages early decissions but also can lack accuracy. 
        It may be hard to understand if you are not creating the wireframe yourself compared to digital tools which may 
        be more clearer to understand.

        A low-fi wireframe for my project would be best because, it will be enough detail while also making sure that
