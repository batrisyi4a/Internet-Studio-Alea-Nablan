      <p>
        Choi Seungcheol, better known as <strong>S.Coups</strong>, is the leader of the global K-pop group 
        <strong>SEVENTEEN</strong>. Born in Daegu, South Korea, he has led the 13-member group 
        (divided into 3 sub-units) with compassion, discipline, and unity since their debut in 2015. 
        Known for his balanced leadership and strong sense of responsibility, S.Coups inspires both 
        his team and fans through his humility and dedication.
      </p>

      <p>
        S.Coups would make an excellent president because he already embodies the spirit of a true leader — 
        one who listens, communicates, and uplifts others. His ability to manage and motivate a large, 
        diverse group with patience and empathy shows that he can bring people together toward a common goal.
