	<h1>Part 2</h1>
	<h2><strong>K-Pop Budgeting Project - Six Thinking Hats</strong></h2>
    <h3>White Hat (Information)</h3>

    <p>
During the discussion we had, we discussed the general understanding of what kpop fans typically spend on merchandise, concert tickets and albums, 
also noting the average cost of these items. We also noted that some groups with more popularity also tend to have more variety as well as pricier items. 
I decided that in order to find this information, I would gather information through surveys, online forums and fan communities to gain valuable information 
for the potential solution

    </p>

    <h3>Red Hat (Feelings & Intuition)</h3>

    <p>
I expressed my hesitation about the coding aspect, that I am afraid that I wouldn't feel confident in my ability to implement all the features due to my lack 
of coding knowledge. Overall, I think the biggest challenge for me would be the coding part, and this might also help me stay realistic with the features. 

    </p>

    <h3>Black Hat (Caution & Critical Thinking)</h3>

    <p>
Some of the potential problems would be if users would use the app itself. Fans may not want to track their spendings as it would feel restrictive. 
We also considered whether focusing too heavily on budgeting might make the app feel judgmental rather than supportive. 
    </p>

    <h3>Yellow Hat (Optimism & Benefits)</h3>

    <p>
We discussed some of the positive aspects this project may have and how it could succeed. This could provide value for kpop fans to manage their 
spending which can overall reduce financial stress. The tool could be appealing if it included gamified elements. For example, if a fan is tracked 
saving a certain amount of money, we would provide discounts to their next album purchase or concert ticket. Overall, we felt that the project had 
strong potential to combine financial literacy with fandom engagement, making it both educational and enjoyable.

    </p>

    <h3>Green Hat (Creativity & Alternatives)</h3>

    <p>
We brainstormed alternative approaches and innovative solutions. One idea was to add customizable budgets based on different types of K-pop 
activities, such as concerts, albums, or merchandise. Another was to include educational content that teaches budgeting in small, relatable 
steps for fans who are new to finance. These creative solutions helped us brainstorm different ways for usability. 

    </p>

    <h3>Blue Hat (Summary & Next Steps)</h3>

    <p>
Overall, the goal would be to create a kpop budgeting website. 

For each hat we had different conclusions

    </p>
	<ul>
		<li>White hat: we need more concrete data to back up our features to ensure that they will be useful for the target audience</li>
		<li>Red hat: challenges of coding skills</li>
		<li>Black hat: risk of user engagement</li>
		<li>Yellow hat: benefits of gamified and personalized features</li>
        <li>Green hat: creative solutions to address weaknesses</li>
	</ul>
<p>Moving forward, we decided to research spending data, simplify coding tasks, and incorporate gamification and educational elements in the design.</p>
