		<p>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</p>	
      <li>The difference between structured content and semantic HTML is that structured content is planned and organized. For example, recipes, how-to profiles, etc. is content that is broken into different chunks. While semantic HTML is code that code that both humans and algorithms can understand. For example how < h1 > tells both the algorithm and humans that its a main heading, < h2 > sub heading, etc. </li>
		<p>How do they work together?</p>
      <li>These two elements work together as structured content gives the framework and provides the informational chunks as well as showcases how they relate. Then semantic html will turn that framework into reliable code for the machine.</li>
	  	<p>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</p>
	<li>It is important to have these two in your web pages as it allows for both machines and humans to understand the content. Without both, the content may not be able to be detected by search engines but remain fine for human readers. </li>

	<h4>part 4</h3>
	<p>I believe that the method of aiming for “good” instead of striving for the superlative would be the most successful for me. After 3 years of college surrounded by other creative and successful individuals, I have put a hard expectation on myself to always go above and beyond in everything I do. While this is a good idea in theory, in the end, I often times find myself nitpicking at my own work and putting myall in something that maybe wasnt as big of a deal as I made it to be. By constantly seeking forperfection, I have overlooked what I have already accomplished and also feel as though I never work hard enough to achive better things. Being able to accept that sometimes “ good” or “average” is enough would help me find the balance between giving out meaningful work while still keeping a healthy environemnt for growth. </p>
	<p>Hyperbolic discounting is essentially the tendency to want to complete smaller immediate rewards over long-term rewards. This shows why many people give into the idea of short-term gratification. While they are satisfied in that moment, in the long run, they will regret choosing short-term gratification over the more daunting task but more benefiital reward. 
One method that is talked about in the article to help counteract hyperbolic discounting is to make choices in the present to stop your future self from procrastinating. For example, using apps that block social media on your phone to stop you from getting distracted. 
I believe this method works best for me and is something I personally do to help myself from getting distracted. On different apps such as tiktok, I have a timer that will lock out if I go past a certain screen time on that certain app. </p>
	<p> I have some network-making power as I am able to control what content to share, how its design as well as the audience its designed for. While I am able to control these factors there are also many other parentsI am not able to control such as algorithm of the potential users and their ability to find my website through the web. While I can influence accessibility and engagement  through how I design my applications, the overall structure has more of an influence on how my work is seen.
