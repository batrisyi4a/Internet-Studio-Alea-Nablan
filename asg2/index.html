		<p>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</p>	
      <li>The difference between structured content and semantic HTML is that structured content is planned and organized. For example, recipes, how-to profiles, etc. is content that is broken into different chunks. While semantic HTML is code that code that both humans and algorithms can understand. For example how < h1 > tells both the algorithm and humans that its a main heading, < h2 > sub heading, etc. </li>
		<p>How do they work together?</p>
      <li>These two elements work together as structured content gives the framework and provides the informational chunks as well as showcases how they relate. Then semantic html will turn that framework into reliable code for the machine.</li>
	  	<p>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</p>
	<li>It is important to have these two in your web pages as it allows for both machines and humans to understand the content. Without both, the content may not be able to be detected by search engines but remain fine for human readers. </li>
